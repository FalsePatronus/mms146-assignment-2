        <h1> How I Got into UPOU </h1>
<p>
First of all, UPOU means the University of the Philippines Open University. I got a little too many people asking me how I managed to get into such a great university, with half of me being such a laid-back turtle (at least, turtles are cute! Kinda.) and half of me being a Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Divergent, and Marvel Comics Addict (I really don't ship the Fault in Our Stars, don't ask.)
</p>
<p>
So how did I get into UPOU? 
</p>
Simple.
<p>
I took a nap.
</p>
<p>
Seriously. When I took my UPCAT exam at a learning center, I was really nervous. There's like a few hundred test-takers in the main hall where I'm gonna take the exam, and I was like, "Cool, now I won't pass for Broadcasting." (For people out there, I really want to be a broadcaster. That's why I chose courses that could lead me into being one, Multimedia Studies is one of them.) 
</p>
<p>
Being a pessimist, I already have that bad thinking that I can't pass the exam. I've got too many competitors to beat, and BA Broadcasting is a quota course! (NOTE: not a good thought while taking an entrance test.) 
</p>
<p>
So halfway through the examination for Mathematics, I lost my confidence and took a nap.
Great.
</p>
<p>
The moment I woke up, there were only a few minutes left for the Math exam... which means half of the answers for the Math exam were left unanswered. Being the crazy falcon that I am, I guessed answers, (NOTE: lousy move) Not a wise choice really, since it was a right-minus-wrong exam.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to the first day of May 2018.
</p>
<p>
I enrolled in another university, thinking I failed the UPCAT. It was the peak of enrollment in that university so I was really exhausted. Being the crazy falcon that I am (oh, and don't forget the laid-back turtle), I took a nap on that university's food court.
</p>
<p>
My dad, who takes Law at that university, woke me up moments later. He revealed that I passed the UPCAT exam and I got BA in Multimedia Studies in my program. 
</p>
<p>
I mean, wow.
</p>
<p>
University of the Philippines Open University? Multimedia Studies? Who wouldn't get that chance?
</p>
<p>
So basically, I pulled out my documents from that university, which nullified my enrollment there (and got myself blacklisted), and instead, I enrolled at UPOU.
</p>
<p>
After taking a big step while learning at UPOU,  I'm proud to say that it really helped me do fun things (like editing pictures and videos and creating this blog) which I learned while studying MMS 100, one of the first subjects that I had for my first trimester back in my first-year days. I learned a lot of things from MMS 100 that I didn't even think I would have the capability to learn (such as the basics of Photography)
</p>
<p>
I’m now a senior BAMS student at UPOU. Now, I am pretty used to having days without having anything to do, and having days wherein I feel like I’m dying because of the number of activities due.
</p>
<p>
I’ve battled coding systems, photography techniques, and hard-to-learn audio-editing tools. I've finished many self-introductions and templated many comments and reactions to my classmates’ posts. My Google Drive’s capacity is now filled up to 11 GB. All of this was a fun and surprising experience. I never thought I’d get this far.
</p>
<p>
Lesson learned? 
</p>
<p>
Don't just take a nap. Strive hard for your dreams to come true.
